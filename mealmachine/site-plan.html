        Welcome to MealMachine!

        Is meal planning not fun to do? With MealMachine, meal planning will be easier and 
        you favorite thing to do!

        MealMachine is a mealplanner with a shopping list built in. You will first enter your personal 
        preferences in the customizable tab includes your age, dietary restrictions, daily caloric intake, household size, etc. 
        Next, enter your ingredients/ food items already in your fridge, pantry or counter. Being more specific
        on the amount. This is made easy with the barcode product scanner. (This may sound tedious but it is going to be worth it! It's the only hard work you would need to do and this step 
        will also be important later. Trust me ðŸ˜‰.) 
        On the suggested meal ideas tab, with our Artificial Tntelligence (AI) technology, it will take all the 
        ingredients available that you logged into delicious recipes, complex or easy, like you prefer! 
        Or you can even save your own favorite receipes. 
        Once you've chosen the meals, your "food storage" will automatically take out the amount you've used to make your meal.
        Remember your hard work from earlier, after logging all your food items on the "Food Storage" tab, being specific as possible, it has now turned into 
        your personal shopping list. It will tell you what ingredients you are out or need! Extra features include, the expiry date! 
        (This reduces waste and costs, no more expired milk at the back of the fridge!)
        After all this set up, you will just log all the ingredients you bought next time, using the barcode scanner. 
        Finally, sit back with ease, and enjoy with less worries about your next meal!
