        <p>Is meal planning not fun to do? With MealMachine, meal planning 
            will be easier and you favorite thing to do! MealMachine is a mealplanner 
            with a shopping list built in.</p>
        <p>How does MealMachine work?</p>
        <p>You will first enter your personal preferences in the customizable tab includes 
            your age, dietary restrictions, daily caloric intake, household size, etc. Next,
            enter your ingredients/ food items already in your fridge, pantry or counter. 
            Being more specific on the amount. This is made easy with the barcode product 
            scanner. (This may sound tedious but it is going to be worth it! It's the only 
            hard work you would need to do and this step will also be important later. 
            Trust me ðŸ˜‰.) </p>
        <p>On the suggested meal ideas tab, with our Artificial Tntelligence (AI) technology, 
            it will take all the ingredients available that you logged into delicious recipes, 
            complex or easy, like you prefer! Or you can even save your own favorite receipes. 
            Once you've chosen the meals, your "food storage" will automatically take out the 
            amount you've used to make your meal. Remember your hard work from earlier, after 
            logging all your food items on the "Food Storage" tab, being specific as possible, 
            it has now turned into your personal shopping list. It will tell you what ingredients 
            you are out or need! Extra features include, the expiry date! (This reduces waste and 
            costs, no more expired milk at the back of the fridge!) </p>
        <p>After all this set up, you will just log all the ingredients you bought next time, 
            using the barcode scanner. Finally, sit back with ease, and enjoy with less worries 
            about your next meal! Other Services coming soon! Online Nutritionist</p>
